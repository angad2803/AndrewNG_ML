# Deep learning

Hierarchical learning algorithms with many 'layers', (very) loosely inspired by the brain

## Perceptron

One of the earliest algorithms that could learn from data
Implemented in hardware! Weights stored in potentiometers,
updated with electric motors during learning
Connected to a camera that used 20x20 cadmium sulfide
photocells to make a 400-pixel image
Could learn to recognize letters of the alphabet
Today we would recognize it as a linear classifier
