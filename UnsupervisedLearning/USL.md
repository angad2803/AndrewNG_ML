# Clustering in Unsupervised Learning

Clustering is a fundamental technique in **unsupervised learning**, where the goal is to group similar data points together without using labeled data. Unlike supervised learning, unsupervised learning algorithms do not have access to ground truth labels and must find structure in the data on their own.

## What is Clustering?

Clustering algorithms partition a dataset into groups, or _clusters_, such that data points within the same cluster are more similar to each other than to those in other clusters. The similarity is typically measured using distance metrics like Euclidean distance.

## Common Clustering Algorithms

- **K-Means Clustering:** Partitions data into _k_ clusters by minimizing the variance within each cluster.
- **Hierarchical Clustering:** Builds a tree of clusters by either merging or splitting existing clusters.
- **DBSCAN:** Groups together points that are closely packed, marking points in low-density regions as outliers.

## Applications

- Customer segmentation
- Image compression
- Anomaly detection
- Document categorization

## Summary

Clustering helps uncover hidden patterns in data and is widely used in exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, and feature engineering.
